## Sometime you want numbered **lists**:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:

Github also supports something calledcode fencing , which allows for multiple lines without identation:

```
if (isAwesome){
    return True
}

```
Some Python Code

```
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
```
